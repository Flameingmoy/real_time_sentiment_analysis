# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time Sentiment Analysis (RTSA) system is designed to process financial, economic, and geopolitical data streams in real-time and provide actionable sentiment insights for algorithmic trading decisions. This MVP focuses on demonstrating core functionality with a scalable architecture that can handle multiple data sources, perform sentiment analysis using AI models, and present insights through interactive dashboards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Ingestion System

**User Story:** As a trading system operator, I want to ingest data from multiple financial sources in real-time, so that I can analyze market sentiment as events unfold.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external data sources send webhook requests THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the incoming data within 500ms
2. WHEN data is received from TrueData API THEN the system SHALL store raw data in PostgreSQL database with proper indexing
3. WHEN data ingestion rate exceeds 100 messages per second THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without data loss
4. WHEN invalid or malformed data is received THEN the system SHALL reject it and log the error appropriately
5. IF multiple data sources send data simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently using goroutines
6. WHEN raw data is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL publish a message to Kafka topic for further processing

### Requirement 2: Message Queue Processing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want asynchronous message processing between services, so that the system can handle varying loads and maintain reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw data is ingested THEN the system SHALL publish messages to appropriate Kafka topics based on data type
2. WHEN sentiment analysis service is available THEN it SHALL consume messages from sentiment_analysis_topic
3. IF message processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN results SHALL be published to aggregation_topic
5. WHEN urgent sentiment changes are detected THEN alerts SHALL be published to alert_topic
6. IF Kafka broker becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation and recovery

### Requirement 3: Sentiment Analysis Processing

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want automated sentiment analysis of incoming data, so that I can quickly identify market sentiment trends without manual review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text data is received for analysis THEN the system SHALL preprocess and clean the content
2. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL generate sentiment scores using IBM Granite 3.3 model
3. WHEN sentiment analysis is complete THEN results SHALL include confidence scores and entity extraction
4. IF duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL use vector similarity search to avoid reprocessing
5. WHEN sentiment analysis takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning
6. WHEN analysis is complete THEN results SHALL be stored in analytics PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 4: Vector Storage and Deduplication

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to avoid processing duplicate content, so that computational resources are used efficiently and data quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new content is received THEN the system SHALL generate text embeddings for similarity comparison
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in Redis vector store with appropriate indexing
3. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN vector similarity search SHALL complete within 100ms
4. IF content similarity exceeds 95% threshold THEN the system SHALL mark as duplicate and skip processing
5. WHEN vector store reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup policies for old embeddings

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Analytics

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want structured storage of processed sentiment data, so that I can perform historical analysis and generate insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sentiment analysis is complete THEN results SHALL be stored in structured format in analytics database
2. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as source, timestamp, and confidence scores
3. WHEN querying historical data THEN database responses SHALL complete within 500ms for dashboard queries
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and retry logic
5. WHEN raw data exceeds 7-day retention THEN the system SHALL automatically purge old records
6. WHEN analytics data is queried THEN proper indexing SHALL ensure efficient retrieval

### Requirement 6: Real-time Visualization

**User Story:** As a trading decision maker, I want real-time dashboards showing sentiment trends, so that I can make informed trading decisions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sentiment data is available THEN Grafana dashboards SHALL display real-time trends with 30-second refresh intervals
2. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN users SHALL see sentiment trends by asset class, source volume metrics, and historical analysis
3. WHEN sentiment thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger configurable alerts
4. IF dashboard queries take longer than 500ms THEN performance optimization SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN multiple users access dashboards THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access without performance degradation

### Requirement 7: System Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component operates THEN it SHALL generate structured logs with appropriate levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for troubleshooting
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL capture relevant metrics
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement basic alerting mechanisms
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in dedicated PostgreSQL database with daily partitioning
6. WHEN log retention exceeds configured limits THEN old logs SHALL be automatically purged

### Requirement 8: API Integration and External Sources

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want integration with multiple external data sources, so that sentiment analysis covers comprehensive market information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with TrueData API THEN the system SHALL handle real-time financial data streams
2. WHEN accessing news APIs THEN the system SHALL integrate with Reuters and Bloomberg alternatives
3. WHEN connecting to social media THEN the system SHALL use Twitter API v2 and Reddit API appropriately
4. IF external API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement proper throttling and queuing
5. WHEN API credentials expire THEN the system SHALL handle authentication renewal gracefully
6. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with available sources

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to meet performance targets, so that it can handle production trading environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing data THEN ingestion latency SHALL be less than 500ms per data source
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain 100+ messages per second throughput
3. WHEN performing vector searches THEN response time SHALL be less than 100ms
4. WHEN analyzing sentiment THEN processing time SHALL be less than 10 seconds per analysis
5. IF system load increases THEN basic horizontal scaling SHALL be possible
6. WHEN storing daily data THEN the system SHALL handle 1GB of new data per day efficiently
